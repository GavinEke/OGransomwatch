    <p>In the last few days, we've been noticing a wave of so-called "Security Researchers"âor let's say, wannabesâwho are circulating fake samples, fake notes, and fake everything related to our "Locker."</p>
    <p>This is happening even before our Locker is fully ready, which was already used in the CCP and a demo version in the Pinger attack. Even the note being circulated is fake. To set the record straight, hereâs a real note that any system affected by our ransomware will identify:  <a href="/Note.txt" target="_blank">/Note.txt</a></p>
    <p>As for the sample, no oneâliterally no oneâhas a copy of our Locker. Crazy, right?</p>
    <p>However, weâre offering a little gift and a surprise to those so-called security researchers. Hereâs a sample of our Lockerâs demo version. Good luck trying to decrypt or reverse-engineer any of the tools that are going to be used in our future attacks. ;)</p>
    <p>And our current Locker operates at a speed that even larger ransomwares like RansomHub and MEDUSA can't compare to... completely unbeatable. And donât act surprised.</p>
    <p>Hereâs an earlier version targeting Windows: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f40fa2cb68a8ddbd751debebe41d44a48a4be4a6468f33c1cf1529d81e665279" target="_blank">https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f40fa2cb68a8ddbd751debebe41d44a48a4be4a6468f33c1cf1529d81e665279</a></p>
    <p>Cute, right?</p>
    <p>Good luck, security researchers. Oh, and also: None of that "M****eus Ransomware is HELLCAT, H***d**n is HELLCAT" nonsense is true. We are currently affiliated with one ransomware team, and itâs pretty huge.</p>
    <p>Weâve got a surprise for you coming very soon...<br>Weâll have some fun together very soon.</p>
