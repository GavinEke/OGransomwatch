ransomwatch trails the extortion sites used by ransomware groups and surfaces an aggregated feed of claims

_content within `ransomwatch.telemetry.ltd`, `posts.json`, `groups.json` alongside the `docs/` & `source/` directories is dynamically generated based on hosting choices of real-world threat actors in near-real-time._

_whilst sanitisation efforts have been taken, by viewing or accessing ransomwatch you acknowledge you are doing so at your own risk_

### key outputs

`web://` [`ransomwatch.telemetry.ltd`](https://ransomwatch.telemetry.ltd)

`json://` [`ransomwhat.telemetry.ltd/posts`](https://ransomwhat.telemetry.ltd/posts)

`json://` [`ransomwhat.telemetry.ltd/groups`](https://ransomwhat.telemetry.ltd/groups)

- _`groups.json` contains hosts, nodes, relays and mirrors for a tracked group or actor_
- _`posts.json` contains extracted posts, noted by their discovery time and accountable group_


## technicals

this is a live repository that utilizes a combination of GitHub actions and a [service container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers). it visits, parses, and reports on monitored hosts in near-real-time in a self-contained manner

content fetching is done with [psf/requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) - if rendering is required [mozilla/geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) and [seleniumhq/selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) are leveraged.

The frontend is ultimately generated with markdown, using [markdown.py](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/markdown.py) and served with [docsifyjs/docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify) thanks to [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com)

graphs or visualisations are generated with [plotting.py](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/plotting.py) with the help of [matplotlib/matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)

post indexing is done with a mix of `grep`, `awk` and `sed` within [parsers.py](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/parsers.py) - it's brittle and like any  Ã¥Ã≠ÃÅHÃ∂Ã§ÃìTÃ∏ÃôÃÖMÃ∂ÕáÃæLÃ∑ÕëÕÖ Ã¥ÃôÃèpÃ∏Ã°ÕÜaÃ∑ÃõÃ¶rÃµÃ¨ÃøsÃ¥ÃôÕõƒ©Ã¥Ã∫nÃ∏ÃîÕúgÃ∏ÃòÃà, has a limited lifetime.

## tools

rendered HTML for each page is viewable within the [source](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/tree/main/source) directory

- [screenshotter.py](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/assets/screenshotter.py) _a playwright script to generate high-resolution screenshots of online hosts_
- [srcanalyser.py](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/assets/srcanalyser.py) _a basic extractor for emails, internal and external links found within page source_
- [browse-hosts.sh](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/assets/browse-hosts.sh) _a simple cURL based iterator for sweeping URL checks_
- [sources.sh](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/assets/sources.sh) _an aggregator of various locations that surface new groups for ransomwatch_
- [uptimekuma-importer.py](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/assets/uptimekuma-importer.py) _a script to convert the group data into a [uptime-kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) configuration file_
- [parsers.sh](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/assets/parsers.sh) _a health-check script that provides details on parsers that are returning no fields_

_a flattened version of groups.json with each host as its own object can be found at [assets/groups-kv.json](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/assets/groups-kv.json). the structure is an array of objects, each representing a distinct entity/group with each containing all properties (like `name`, `captcha`, `parser`, etc.) at the same level, including potential repetition on elements such as `profile` and `meta`. some data analysis tools work with this structure in an easier manner requiring less transposing._

## cli operations

_fetching hidden services requires a tor circuit! establish one with;_

```shell
docker run -p9050:9050 ghcr.io/joshhighet/torsocc:latest
```

```shell

positional arguments:
  {add,scrape,parse,markdown}
                        operation to execute

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --name NAME           provider name
